NCT00364013,PRIME: Panitumumab Randomized Trial In Combination With Chemotherapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer to Determine Efficacy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00364013,,COMPLETED,The purpose of this study is to determine the treatment effect of panitumumab in combination with FOLFOX compared to FOLFOX alone as first line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer,YES,Metastatic Colorectal Cancer,DRUG: Panitumumab|DRUG: FOLFOX regimen,"Progression-free Survival, Progression-free survival (PFS), assessed by central radiological assessment, was defined as the time from randomization to disease progression per modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) criteria or death. Participants who were alive but did not meet criteria for progression by the data cutoff date were censored at their last evaluable disease assessment date. Progressive disease is defined as a ≥ 20% increase in the size of target lesions or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions or any new lesions., From randomization until the data cutoff date of 30 September 2008. Maximum follow-up time was 109 weeks.","Overall Survival, The definition of overall survival is the time from randomization to death; participants who were alive at the analysis data cutoff were censored at their last contact date., From randomization until the data cutoff date of 28 August 2009. Maximum time on follow-up was 153 weeks.|Percentage of Participants With an Objective Response, Participants were evaluated for tumor response per the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria every 8 weeks until disease progression. Objective response by central radiological assessment was defined as the incidence of either a confirmed complete or partial response (CR or PR) while on the first-line treatment, as determined by blinded independent central review and confirmed no less than 4-weeks after the criteria for response are first met. CR: Disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions and no progression of non-target or no new lesions, or, disappearance of all target lesions and the persistence of ≥ 1 non-target lesion not qualifying for either CR or progressive disease. Participants without a post-baseline assessment were considered non-responders., Every 8 weeks until disease progression up to the data cut-off date of 30 September 2008; Maximum follow-up time was 109 weeks.|Time to Progression, Time to progression was defined as time from randomization date to date of disease progression per the modified RECIST criteria., From randomization until the data cut-off date of 30 September 2008; Maximum follow-up time was 109 weeks.|Duration of Response, Duration of response was calculated only for those participants with a confirmed CR or PR, as the time from the first CR or PR (subsequently confirmed within no less than 4 weeks) to first observed disease progression per modified RECIST criteria, based on a blinded central review., Every 8 weeks until disease progression up to the data cut-off date of 30 September 2008; Maximum follow-up time was 109 weeks.|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an AE that • is fatal • is life threatening • requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • is a congenital anomaly/birth defect • other significant medical hazard. The relationship of the adverse event to the study treatment was assessed by the Investigator by means of the question: ""Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study treatment?"", From randomization until the data cut-off date of 28 August 2009; Maximum time on follow-up was 153 weeks.",,Amgen,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,1183,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,20050203,2006-08-01,2009-08-01,2013-03-22,2006-08-15,2014-02-13,2022-11-07,,
